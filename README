prefixdistro is OpenEmbedded layer to produce a distribution completely
rooted with arbitrary filesystem prefix, intended to run alongside
pre-existing system.

Requirements:

 * Completely relocatable, this includes not only things like
   /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf, but even /dev/log.
 * Should be able to run without root privileges.
 * Should be easy to boostrap via package manager.
 * Should have simplified package dependencies if makes sense
   (for example, busybox package should not pull daemons).
 * Should have simplified/streamlines service architecture.

This layer depends on:

URI: git://github.com/pfalcon/oe-core.git

revision: HEAD

Quick start:

git clone git://github.com/pfalcon/oe-core.git
git co obey-prefixes
git clone git://git.openembedded.org/bitbake.git

. oe-init-build-env
bitbake busybox
