prefixdistro is OpenEmbedded layer to produce a distribution completely
rooted with arbitrary filesystem prefix, intended to run alongside
pre-existing system.

Requirements:

 * Completely relocatable, this includes not only things like
   /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf, but even /dev/log.
 * Should be able to run without root privileges.
 * Should be easy to boostrap via package manager.
 * Should have simplified package dependencies if makes sense
   (for example, busybox package should not pull daemons).
 * Should have simplified/streamlines service architecture.
